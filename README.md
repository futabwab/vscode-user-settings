# vscode-user-settings
my settings for VSCode to keep them in sync across computers  
content of C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Code\User folder

# Notes
- cobalt2-custom-hacks.css is an unodified version of [css file](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode/blob/master/cobalt2-custom-hacks.css) from official [cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2)
- to update the extension-list.txt run `code --list-extensions > %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\extension-list.txt`

# Resources
- official [getting started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)

# ToDos
- having cobalt2 css as a submodule if it would be changing often or just to give credit in cleaner way
- create a bash script that would install code extensions from the list
